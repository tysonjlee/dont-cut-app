# Don't Cut!

## What Is It? 

**Don't Cut!** is a web app designed for car enthusiasts to discover and plan exciting driving routes based on customizable preferences such as road curviness, weather conditions, elevation changes, and more. Inspired by touge culture, this app aims to make finding the perfect road for a cruise or spirited drive easier, more enjoyable, and safer for all involved.

## Motivation

Growing up with an all-things love for cars, racing, and automotive engineering, I wanted an app that would allow me to generate scenic drive routes effortlessly, helping me plan my weekend retreats through the curvy mountain roads. 

Moreover, with an extensive motorsports club and ~~tasteful~~ enthusiastic car culture here in Davis, CA (the place I go to college at - go Aggies!!), I wanted to provide a tool that supports both my personal hobbies as well as my community. 

Thus, was born the idea of this app - **Don't Cut!**

## Purpose

While this project also serves as a useful tool for car enthusiasts, it is primarily for my **personal growth** as I explore web and app development more deeply. Through building **Don't Cut!**, I aim to:

- Strengthen my skills in **front-end and back-end web development**.
- Learn how to work with **APIs** for maps, weather, and routing.
- Understand **full-stack app architecture**.
- Improve my knowledge of **UI/UX** design with a focus on automotive communities and their users.

## Long-Term Vision

As mentioned, this is a **personal side project** that I plan to work on over time, continually improving as I learn more and refine the features. While it is currently a proof-of-concept, I am committed to iterating on it and possibly expanding its scope in the future.
