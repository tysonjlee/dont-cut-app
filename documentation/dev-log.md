# Dev Log

Welcome to my development log! This is where I document my core changes & decisions while building **Don't Cut!**.

Keeping things simple, each entry will include a small synopsis of the most recent work, recording notable changes or milestones to the project. 

I plan on updating this log frequently in regular intervals.

## Project Kickoff [04-25-2025]
I am excited to announce the start of this project! 

**Don't Cut!** started from the motive of creating a route-planning web app for car enthusiasts, featuring customizable filters for finding fun and scenic drives.

I am currently in the design stage, doing basic things such as framework research, physical page sketches, etc. 

Here's a list of major decisions & research I've done so far: 

- **Stuck with HTML/CSS/JS instead of React Native** --> Want to learn the core triad of web dev well before jumping into frameworks & tools
